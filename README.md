# Course Register System

* In this project I created a CONTACT on Near Platform that builds a course register system

* In this contract a Course has some parameters: coursename, coursse details, cours owner, course id

* Students can choose a course for registering

* 2 functions are created: one of them is call a course from id, other one calls all courses

* To use the project, you can run bash scripts under scripts folder
